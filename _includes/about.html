                                        A group of Columbus Crew fans living and visiting New York City gathered together at the popular Brooklyn soccer saloon <a href="https://banterbrooklyn.com/">Banter Bar</a> on December 9, 2023. They giddily watched their favorite club triumph in the MLS Cup championship match. Such a good time was had, another watch party was organized at Banter Bar for Crewsmas 2024. Attended by a number of totally normal Crew fans who wanted to meet up again and again to watch their club play on TV, Crew York was formed.

                                        We've publicized this group to help organize and communicate with fellow Crew fans in and around the city, as well as those passing through on match days. A year after Crew York's founding, we designed a badge, which prompted the <a href="https://nordecke.com/nordecke-collective-members/">Nordecke</a> to recognize it as an official local supporters group. We join <a href="https://nordecke.com/norontour/">NorOnTour</a> for Crew games in the NYC area â€” and beyond. Look for our banner at tailgates and in the stadiums.
